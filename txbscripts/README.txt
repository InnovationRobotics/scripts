The currently included scripts should be run from an administrator console and are described below:

-- .git_filters directory includes the scripts for the keyword expansion; 
-- .gitattributes is a file that defines which are the files that would pass via the filters (for git expansion); It should be included in all 
repositories that needs keyword expansion for the registration standard. It should be includes anywhere code is developed for 
software development good practise.

TAXIBOT directory and run from there.
